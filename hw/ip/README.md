# Hardware IP Blocks

This is a catalogue of all the hardware IP blocks that belong to the OpenTitan project.
Each hardware IP block has its own overview, theory of operations and user reference.
The overview gives you a quick summary of what the block does, while the theory of operations goes into more details of how the internal hardware works.
If you only want to know how to use a block, please have a look at the user guide.
