# Common SystemVerilog and UVM Components

OpenTitan's common SystemVerilog and UVM components used in the verification infrastructure.
SystemVerilog is an industry standard hardware description language.
UVM stands for Universal Verification Methodology, and is a mature testing framework to create production-ready RTL.

These components are not documented directly inside each IP block because multiple hardware IP blocks use them.
They include:
- Comportability
- UVM agents
- UVM monitors
- Interfaces
- Utilities
- Testing infrastructure
