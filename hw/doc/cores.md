# Cores

The cores in OpenTitan are hardware blocks that can rung programs.
In OpenTitan, we use [Ibex](../ip/rv_core_ibex/index.html) as the general-purpose CPU.
OpenTitan also includes [OTBN](../ip/otbn/index.html), which is a custom core to accelerate big number operations like elliptic curve cryptography.
